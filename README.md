# Portfolio Website
This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my work, skills, and professional experiences. The site features a clean and modern responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. It includes sections like "About Me," where I introduce myself; "Projects," highlighting my work with detailed descriptions, live demos, and links to source code; and "Skills," outlining the technologies and tools I am proficient in. Additionally, there's a blog section where I share tutorials, industry insights, and personal reflections. A contact form is also provided, offering a simple and secure way for visitors to get in touch with me. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
